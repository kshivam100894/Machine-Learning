# Machine-Learning
The purpose of this repository is to provide an overview of machine learning and statistical techniques for learners trying to get a familiarisation with predictive modelling techniques. The key notion is that flexible, automatic approaches are used to detect patterns within the data, with a primary focus on making predictions on future data.
